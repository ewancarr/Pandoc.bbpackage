Pandoc.bbpackage
================

These scripts export the current document (in [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) Markdown) to PDF, DOCX or HTML.

- You'll need to configure each one (e.g. add bibliography information, style files). 
- They work out of the `/tmp/` directory.
- Because of this, for images to work you'll need the full path.

I'll add additional functions as/when I need them.
